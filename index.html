		<img src="./assets/images/cvj_pic1.jpg" alt="Picture of me, outdated" id="me_pic">
		
		<p class="me_text">You never know what you're capable of until you have to rebuild your world. I am finding out my limits and discovering they are much further out than I thought. I come to coding via music, psychology, crochet, and housewifery- all things related to creation and maintenance. Remember- Everything relates to Everything.</p>

		<br>

		<p class="me_text">In addition to creating cloth and stitching geometric patterns, I enjoy reading, singing, and learning. Also, ice cream. My favorite board games are cooperative and I'm pretty sure I'm a Hufflepuff. Other fandoms include Disney, Marvel, Star Trek/Wars, Doctor Who, and more. I have lived in Raleigh for 5 years and am still not used to winter. </p>
